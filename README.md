# big-dictionary
This is a little site I made for fun. It displays definitions for words, and allows users to click any word on the site to see that word's definition.

You should be able to view the live site at [reallybigdictionary.com](http://reallybigdictionary.com).

## Installation
### Prerequisites
You will need to install the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run the site locally.

1. Clone the repository and navigate to it.
1. Run `npm install` from a command prompt.
1. Run `npm run dev` from a command prompt to build and start the site.
